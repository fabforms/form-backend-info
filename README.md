  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

<script>
document.getElementById('contactForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(this);
  fetch('https://fabform.io/f/your-form-id', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Handle success
    console.log('Success:', data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle error
